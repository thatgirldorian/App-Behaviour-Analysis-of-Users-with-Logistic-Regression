App Behaviour Analysis with Logistic Regressio: An Exploratory Data Analysis & Predictive Modelling with the Logistic Regression algorithm 

These days, almost every company has a mobile app.
Many companies provide a free trial so customers can get a feel of their products and hopefully move on to a paid memebership. 
Netflix, Audible and Youtube Red are a few examples.

These companies also need to know who to target and which ads to show you as you scroll through your Facebook feed.

In this project, I'll be building a model that will predict which users will not subscribe to paid membership
so we can launch more marketing products to convert them into paid users.

This project is for a finTech company, TrackIt, that has a paid app which allows its users track all their finances in one place.
To attract customers, TrackIt has a free version of the app with some unlocked features.

My job is to find out which users will most likely not subscribe to paid content, 
so we can give them additional offers or market to them differently. 
This is important because these offers cost money and we would rather not market to users who were going to pay anyways.

**This project isn't finished yet. I am currently taking more Machine Learning courses to increase my knowledge and expertise with
financial data.
